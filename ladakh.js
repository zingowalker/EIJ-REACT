The pass provides a natural divide between the sub-humid/humid Kullu Valley with a primarily Hindu culture (in the south), and the arid/semi-arid high-altitude Lahaul and Spiti valleys with a Buddhist culture (in the north). From that side, we follow our route towards Keylong. Situated at an altitude of 3440 m, Keylong is the headquarters of Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh and the most populated place of that region. The region is strange, exciting, primitive mountainous and delightful. Among the white and brown mountain, Keylong stands out as oasis of greenery in the district. Rudyard Kipling said of the region "Surely the God live here”, this no place for men. Lahaul and Spiti have hardly changed with the time. People still live the way they used to live and strongly believe in conserving nature. Valley, river, mountains and green landscape makes Keylong an exciting picturesque destination for bikers and aside from its amazing landscape, the vicinity of Keylong offers several places, temples, monasteries and bazaar which are worth visiting.',
