            Regarding booking, we ask our clients to make a deposit payment
            towards the complete booking expense. In case you book within 46
            days of the departure date, the full payment is required at the time

            <br />
            Once we accept your booking, we will send you a confirmation
            invoice, which establishes a contractual agreement between us.
            However, if you book within 7 days of departure, the contract will
            exist upon receipt of your deposit. Kindly check your booking
            confirmation invoice for information about final payment. The
            remaining balance of your trip price must be settled 56 days before
            your departure date. Please be aware that full payment is required
            earlier for expeditions bookings. If the balance remains unpaid on

            <span className="font-bold">Age and Health requirements</span>{" "}
            <br />
            Our minimum age policy for most of our trips is 12 years at the time
            of travel. It's mandatory for all travelers under the age of 18 to
            be accompanied by a legal guardian or an escort over the age of 18
            appointed by their legal guardian. The legal guardian or their
            designee will be responsible for the traveler under the age of 18
            day-to-day care. In case of designating an escort, the legal
            guardian must complete and sign a relevant document to delegate
            their authority. Please note that we cannot guarantee triple or
            joining rooms for families, and accompanying adults may need to
            share with others in the group on a twin share basis. <br />
            <br />
            However, some trips may have a higher minimum age requirement, while
            a lower age limit applies to Family trips and Independent
            Adventures. For more information, please check with your consultant
            or agent at the time of inquiry. For most of our trips, there's no
            upper age limit, but we remind you that some trips can be physically
            demanding, and passengers must ensure that they are adequately fit
            to allow full participation. We can provide you with details on
            mandatory health requirements, but please note that we are not
            medical experts. It is your responsibility to obtain proper and
            detailed medical advice at least two months before traveling to
            check for the latest health requirements and recommendations for
            your destination.
