            Eco India Journeys is committed to responsible & eco tourism,
            through its policies and practices, which permeate all aspects of
            its business. The company’s policies aim to ensure that Himalayan
            Summits and its clients act in a way, which is socially,
            environmentally and culturally sound. We feel strongly that all our
            holidays should benefit the local communities, protect the

            religion and heritage. We tread lightly – low volume, low impact
            trekking/touring is the best way of preserving the beautiful and
            fragile places we visit. We personally survey the trekking and other
            destination before we organize tour to the area.
